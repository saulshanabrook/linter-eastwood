# linter-eastwood

This package will lint your Clojure files in Atom using [eastwood][]

## Installation

### Leiningen

Before using this package you will need to have [Leiningen][] installed and
available from your `$PATH`.

Then make sure that you have [eastwood][] installed as well, so that
`lein eastwood` will work.

### Plugin installation

The [Linter][] and package will be installed for you to provide an interface
to this package. If you are using an alternative debugging interface that
supports linter plugins simply disable [Linter][].

If you do not already have it installed, [language-ruby][] will also be
installed for you.

To install this package either search for it from within Atom's settings menu
or run the following command.

```ShellSession
apm install linter-eastwood
```

## Settings

All of `linter-eastwood`'s settings are available from within Atom's settings menu.
If you prefer to manually edit the configuration file the following settings
are available:

*   `leinExecutablePath`: Defaults to `lein`, allowing the `$PATH` to resolve the
    correct location. If you need to override this specify the full path to
    `lein`.
